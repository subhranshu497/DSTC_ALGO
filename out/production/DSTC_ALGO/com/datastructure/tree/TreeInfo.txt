Binary search tree is a tree, whose left children are less than root and right children are greater than the root node.

Traversal
-------
BST can be traversed in 4 ways
    -Level
    -Preorder
    -postOrder
    -Inorder
--------------
Level Traversal - In this way , tree can be traversed level by level
PreOrder Traversal - start from root to left most leaf node , then trverse up in the sequence. root -->left--->right
postorder traversal - starts with left , than right and then root left -->right --> root
Inorder Traversal - starts with the left most leaf node and then traverse , left -->root -->right
    *Inorder traversal of a BST always gives a sorted result
